                    <p><span>T</span>he Caminito del Rey is an 8 kilometer pathway that connects the Conde de Guadalhorce Dam and El Chorro Reservoir in the province of Malaga, Spain. The path traverses The Gaitanes Gorge and feature impressive narrow aerial walkways built on the vertical walls the gorge at an average distance of 100 meters above the river. It was originally built for operators and maintenance staff for a large hydroelectric project, although later it would be used by the villagers of the surrounding areas.</p>

                    The original path was built between 1901 and 1905 by the Chorro Hydroelectric Society. A pioneering project to take advantage of the 100m drop in the river Guadalhorce required the construction of a small dam, a canal, an arch-supported aqueduct across the gorge, and 1,400m of aqueduct- tunnels. Additionally a pathway to provide access for workmen and materials between two hydroelectric sites, namely Salto del Chorro (Chorro waterfall) and Salto de Gaitenejo (Gaitenejo waterfall) was constructed. Work was challenging and sailors from Malaga were called in to hang from ropes fixed at the top of the gorge.
