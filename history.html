                    <p><span>T</span>he Caminito del Rey is pathway that connects the Conde de Guadalhorce Dam and El Chorro Reservoir in the province of Malaga, Spain. The trail traverses The Gaitanes Gorge and features impressive narrow aerial walkways built on the vertical walls the gorge at an average distance of 100 meters above the river. It was originally built for operators and maintenance staff for a large hydroelectric project, although later it would be used by the villagers of the surrounding areas.</p>

                    <h3>Caminito del Rey's Construction</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It is curious that the beginning of the Caminito was precisely the wood. The first boards in the Desfiladero de los Gaitanes were laid in 1901 and were not done by regular workers but by people accustomed to living far from the mainland. It was sailors who assembled that primitive path that barely resembles the current one, tied to ropes from the top of the cliff and suspended in a vacuum, a task to which they were already accustomed on a ship. But the reason that led to this path and everything that surrounds it arose years before, during the construction of the Córdoba-Málaga railway. It was then that the Loring family, which had the railway concession, realized the potential of the Guadalhorce River and the waterfalls of the Desfiladero de los Gaitanes to generate electricity.

                    The engineer and businessman Jorge Loring, first Marquis of Casa Loring, also obtained this concession, but did not manage to exploit it. It would be another engineer linked to the family by marriage, Rafael Benjumea Burín, who took the reins of a project that over the years would lead him to become a minister with Primo de Rivera and the title of Count of Guadalhorce. At the beginning of the 20th century, an important change in energy generation began to take shape in Spain. Gone were the steam engines to make way for hydroelectric plants. Benjumea saw the potential of El Chorro to be able to generate enough energy to serve Malaga and also cover the needs of its industry. His dream was greatly expanded years later and he even supplied electricity to towns in Granada and Almería.

                    In 1903 the Salto Hidroeléctrico del Chorro was put into operation. This small dam raised the level of the river creating a small channel covered by pipes. To control it, Benjumea hired the sailors to build a plank path and thus be able to access the area to carry out maintenance work. He supposed the creation of a parallel platform to control the gate and the accesses to the original dam. It was the first section of the current Caminito del Rey.

                    In 1903, Benjumea founded the Sociedad Hidroeléctrica del Chorro with the aim of building a large reservoir. Once the project was approved, it was reformed again to create a dam 50 meters high and a reservoir capacity of 80 cubic hectometres. Despite the scarcity of materials due to World War I, the works were able to conclude on May 21, 1921. The significance of the project meant that King Alfonso XIII attended to lay the last stone. A stone chair, today known as the King's chair, recorded the monarch's visit. The engineer Benjumea saw in the precarious path of wooden boards an opportunity to surprise the monarch. During the big work he decided to go one step further: he removed the old structure and replaced it with cement and railway beams as support.

                        <h3>Abandonment and Fall Into Ruin</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The road was in good condition while it was an essential route for the neighbors. It even came to have a guard who was in charge of its maintenance and cleaning. Over the years, the path ceased to be essential and it was abandoned. The passage of time and the movement of animals caused the stones to fall on the route and cause serious damage, especially in those areas where the thickness of the cement was less. The route ended up losing a good part of the railing.

                    <p>
                        Since then, the passage through the Caminito del Rey has become a dangerous route. The holes in the layout and the total absence of sections made it necessary to cling to the wall or make reckless jumps over the void. The visitors gave way to people looking for an experience, mainly related to mountaineering or climbing. And the black legend began.

                    <p>
                        In the mid-1990s, and after several fatal accidents, it was decided to permanently close the footbridge. Some residents of the area point out that the definitive reason was the death on July 23, 1993 of the 12-year-old girl Rosa Polo, a native of the Seville municipality of La Rinconada. The minor went to the place on an excursion organized by the monitors of the summer camps. Apparently, as published by the ABC newspaper in Seville, she was the first in a row and fell through a hole that she did not see on the catwalk.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As a result of this event, voices began to emerge demanding the closure of the route. Soon after, it was decided to blow up the first sections of the entrance, both in the part that corresponds to Ardales and in Álora, and fines were issued to those who accessed it. But nothing stopped the most daring, who further popularized the tour by recording videos showing their dangerous feats.

                        It was not, however, the death of the Caminito del Rey. On 28 March 2015, after one year of restoration work and five million euros’ public investment, the path was reopened to the public, and quickly became one of the most attractive destinations in the world and a great driver of tourism in the region. In 2019, its candidacy for UNESCO World Heritage recognition was submitted.
